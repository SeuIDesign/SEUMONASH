            In the final, the three students accomplished the sketch design, model presentation and stage extemporaneous interpretation of design concepts and passed the other tests. Eventually, Jiang Jinlin from Southeast University came to the fore with the attendance of on-site car designers, media, college teachers and students, gained the title of "Guangzhou Automobile Design Star", and received 50,000 yuan as rewards and a chance to study abroad for a month.

            The competition organized by the Guangzhou Automobile Research Institute, focusing on the Cenozoic design strength of the automotive design community, was aimed to explore the future automotive design elites. The competition attracted 189 students from 72 universities around the world. In addition to receiving the prize money, the GAC Academy will provide funding support for further studies and overseas study tours. Wang Quinine, dean of Guangzhou Automobile Research Institute, pointed out that he hoped that GAC could be developed to be a platform which could give more chances for young designers to display themselves and discovered and trained them to be the backbone of the future of China's automobile industry.
