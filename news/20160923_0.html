            Dyson Design Award was hold by James Dyson Foundation from 2004. As an international engineering design award, Dyson Design Award held the competition in the United States, Australia, England, Belgium, Germany, Japan, China, Hong Kong, China Taiwan and other 22 countries and regions. This year is the first year of this international design competition for college students entering the Chinese mainland. “Micro-steaming Food Box” won the first prize in China, and four works won the final list award.

            September 22, 2016, two judges of Dyson Design Awards in China - Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University, Dean Lu Xiaobo and Southeast University, Director of Industrial Design Department, Xue Chengqi, together with Dyson global product development director Paul Dawson, made a brief sharing for the successful competition in China in Ginkgo Art Center.

        <p>
          Southeast University, Director of Industrial Design Department, Xue Chengqi, thinks that Dyson Design Award concept is worth pursuing. “As the conceptual design may ultimately not be achieved, Dyson Design Award based on solving practical problems and embrace of a number of areas, for example, the award-winning works in China will benefit most people including the elderly and children, this is an industrial design quality worth insisting. The Dyson Design Award also provides Chinese students with a good platform to show their creativity, competing with international design will also promote domestic design education.”
            </p>

            2016 the National Winner of Dyson Design Award is from the Department of Industrial Design, Tongji University, 2016, Chen Xiaoru graduates (23 years old). With the "Microwave Steamer”, Chen Xiaoru became the first Dyson Design Award winner of the China Awards. Southeast University, Director of Industrial Design Department, Xue Chengqi: “in this design work, the food holder made of metal materials, microwave cannot enter, but microwave can pass the water-holding part, through heating water to the steam to heat the upper part. The application of Composite material, eliminating the spark caused by the directly contact of the microwave and metal. Although this idea looks ordinary, it reflects the design thinking.”
